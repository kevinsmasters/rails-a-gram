# README

Project based off of [MalachiRails Learn Ruby on Rails Create Instagram](https://www.youtube.com/@MalachiRails) with some customizations added along the way.

There were some missing details in the tutorial that made for great practice and problem-solving in Rails.

My inspiration for taking on this tutorial came from the final project requirement in an Udemy Ruby on Rails for Developers course I had just completed. 

The main requirements for the final project were:

- Follow users
- Build news feeds of their updates
- Search users
- Comments to images
- Likes

More Rspec tests to be added.
